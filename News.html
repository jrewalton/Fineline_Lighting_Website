        <h2> <br> Study: Fineline at Brixton Village</h2>


        <p><br><strong>The Client:</strong> Brixton Village<strong><br><br>The Brief: </strong>Install a 
        new lighting system to give the Brixton Village team more flexibility, and to give the space a 
        warmer, more welcoming feel for customers. <strong><br><br>The Job: </strong><br><br>In October 
        2020, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Fineline Lighting were enlisted by Brixton Village to
        revamp the market’s lighting system. Two years ago the market was purchased by Hondo Enterprises,
        which has since been on a journey to update and upgrade the space while maintaining the integrity 
        of the Grade II-listed architecture. <br><br>“The lighting had always been a problem across the 
        two covered markets,” says General Manager Diana Nabagereka. “The centralised overhead white 
        lights gave the effect of a mortuary. It didn’t work for a night time economy.” <br><br>By day,
        Brixton Village is a traditional market, by night a popular nightlife hub with restaurants, 
        rooftop bars and a bar playing jazz music. Fineline Lighting were enlisted to create an ambient, 
        comfortable atmosphere for the market’s nightlife to flourish, but equally for a warmer and more 
        pleasant tone throughout the winter days. <br><br>“There is always a complexity with reimagining
        Grade II-listed buildings, so we wanted a solution that was warm yet impactful and still 
        showcased the architecture,” continues Diana. “The new lighting solution formed part of an 
        extensive upgrade of the markets, as such it was important Hondo Enterprises found something 
        equally cost-effective and efficient as an ongoing product.”<br><br>“There was no overselling, 
        with Fineline. They understood our needs clearly and provided a solution, with no frills.” says 
        Diana. “They presented the festoon lighting option, which has been tried and tested in a number 
        of retail and dining locations. The result is a now transformed environment.”<br><br>The planned 
        four-week overnight install was completed in just over three weeks.<br><br>“It was a large-scale 
        installation with over 1,000 lamps, spanning 30,000sqft. The team worked fastidiously, in a 
        professional and highly efficient manner.”<br><br>When it comes to working with the Fineline
        Lighting team, Diana concludes: “Working with contractors can often be fuelled with unexpected 
        delays and additional cost. None of these were experienced with Fineline. They were a pleasure 
        throughout, and went above and beyond at each stage, including a follow up tutorial of the 
        system.”<strong><br><br>The Tech Specs: </strong><br><br>Approximately 1km of festoon lighting

        <h2>Fineline Illuminates Pyramid Stage in support of #lightitred campaign </h2>

        <p>On Monday 6 July the live events and creative industries came together for the #lightitred campaign,
        which aimed to highlight the critical stage the sector is in due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br></p>
        </div>
        <div class= "newsimg2"><img src="images/Fineline-Glastonbury-Pyramid-in-red-IMG_6333.jpg" class= "brixtonimg"></div>
        <div class= "art3">
        <p><br>The campaign was inspired by Germany’s #NightofLight on 22 June, which saw over 9,000 buildings,
        monuments, structures, towers, landmarks, castles, offices,<br>houses and more illuminated in 
        “emergency red” to raise awareness for the arts and creative industries.</p>
        <p>In support of #lightitinred, Fineline Lighting Director Rob Sangwell reached out to the team behind 
        Glastonbury Festival with an idea to light up one of the most iconic and well known structures in 
        the world of live events: The Pyramid Stage. <br><br>With the support of the festival, along with 
        the countless venues and businesses that took part in the campaign, the industry’s urgent message 
        reached a wide audience and gained the attention of several high profile publications including NME 
        magazine. <br></p>
        <p>The campaign comes as the government announces a £1.57bn support package for the arts and creatives 
        industries, which was welcomed by many but may be thinly spread across what is a large and diverse 
        industry supporting a high number of temporary workers, small businesses and freelancers. <br><br>
        Andy Lenthall, GM of the Production Services Association, said: “We welcome the announcement of the 
        support package and we are working in collaboration with the live events sector to ensure that this
        and other support is distributed throughout the supply chain, beyond empty venues, to the people 
        and companies that create and enable events. #lightitinred is a prime example of how our supply 
        chain can emerge from the background and create an impact.”</p>

        <div class= "art3">
        <p>Rob Sangwell added: “A lot of people pulled together to make this happen, a massive thankyou to  
        Michael Eavis, Emily Eavis, Haggis Mcleod, Jason Bryant,<br>Chris Salmon and Rob Kearle from 
        Glastonbury Festival; Jim Creed from Powerline, who loaned us the generator; and the crew:  
        James Harrington, Reuben Pinkney, Chris Randall and Fox Valentine.</p>
